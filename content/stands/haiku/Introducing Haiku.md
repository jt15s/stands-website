# Introducing Haiku

Haiku is an open-source operating system inspired by BeOS and licensed under the MIT license. Specifically targeting personal computing, Haiku is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn, and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels. In fact, users will find that Haiku performs well on even the oldest 32-bit computers!

## What's BeOS?

The Be Operating System (BeOS), a discontinued operating system by Be Inc., introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing.   
Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free. With only very few components open-sourced by Be Inc., almost all of the OS was built from scratch; modelled after the BeOS, though with many aspects extended and modernized.

## Who is Haiku targeting?

Haiku is targeted towards a variety of user groups. These include:

- General desktop users
- Computer hobbyists/"tinkerers"
- App developers
- Computer software researchers
