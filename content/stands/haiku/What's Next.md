# What's Next

We are steaming ahead towards the next major release - Beta 3. Like Beta 2 it will bring about more improvements, more software and more bug fixes. 

Currently we expect Beta 3 to be released in the first half of 2021.

## Beta 3 and Onwards

R1, for those who don't know, will be a fully stable release of Haiku.   
The current plan is to release Beta 3 and then start a new release cycle for Beta 4, where the developers will select issues and tasks filed in the bug tracker under the "R1 milestone" to include in Beta 4. This process will be repeated for any consequent Beta releases until all the issues filed under the "R1" milestone on our bug tracker have been closed.   
Ideally, the developer team is aiming for yearly releases starting with Beta 3, thus Beta 4 is estimated to be released some time next year - 2022.

After R1, work on R1.1 (an update to improve the user experience and fix any bugs in R1) as well as on R2 (the next major stable release of Haiku) will start parallel. It is important we fix any issues for users on R1, but it is also important that to start working on the next major release. Note that this plan may still be subject to change.

## General Plans for Web Infrastructure

After Beta 3, we are looking to update our translation infrastructure (currently the now unmaintained Pootle framework) to use a more modern and up-to-date solution. Plans for this are still in the works, but the developers already have several options in mind.

We also have plans to introduce automated OpenQA testing and single sign-on to all Haiku web applications, but unfortunately those are on the backlog due to the lack of time and volunteers available.   
**Any individuals wishing to help out with these tasks are more than welcome**, and are advised to send an email to the [Haiku mailing list](https://www.freelists.org/list/haiku) or post a message on the [Haiku forums](http://discuss.haiku-os.org)
